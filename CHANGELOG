# CHANGELOG

## 2024

### September 11

- Cleaned up the licensing, added copyright notices to Java files

### September 06

- Cleaned up the JSON produced by the various VO classes.
  - Created new VO classes for returning rule history.
- Fixed a bug preventing the plugin from compiling against the latest versions of iiq-common-public.
- Converted the Javascript code to TypeScript, preparing it for conversion to AngularJS components and then Angular 15+.
  - Began separating 'service' stuff, like Execution History, from the main controllers.
- Made multiple self-monitoring utilities available to running rules:
  - `__worker` is now a reference to the `SailPointWorker` object that is running the Beanshell code.
  - `monitor` has some additional methods for reporting progress more fluently.
- Added a new plugin setting, `createTaskResult`, which will create a TaskResult for every Rule Runner execution, allowing more than one person to monitor the progress of long-running rules.
